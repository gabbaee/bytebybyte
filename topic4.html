                        </ul>                
                </ul>
                <h3>Expansion Cards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Special expansion cards are one way to add new types of ports to an older computer or to expand the number of ports on your computer. </li>
                    <li>Like other expansion cards, these cards clip into an open expansion slot on the motherboard.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>Video Card (AKA graphics card) </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is an expansion card that converts data from the CPU or GPU into images displayed on the monitor.</li>
                    <li>It serves as an alternative to integrated graphics, providing dedicated graphics processing.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>Modern video cards include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ports for connecting to various video equipment.</li>
                    <li>Video memory (RAM) for faster graphics handling.</li>
                    <li>Their own GPU, which offloads graphics processing from the CPU.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>Benefits of a dedicated video card</h3>

                    <li>Speeds up graphics processing and improves overall system performance.</li>
                    <li>Enhances color display; bit depth determines color detail, with higher bit depth providing richer color quality.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>Sound Cards </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attached to the motherboard and enables the computer to record and reproduce sounds.</li>
                    <li>Most computers ship with a basic sound card, most often a 3D sound card. 3D sound is better than stereo sound at convincing the human car that sound is omnidirectional, meaning that you can't tell what direction the sound is coming from. This tends to produce a fuller, richer sound than stereo sound.</li>
                    <li>To set up surround sound on your computer, you need two things: a set of surround-sound speakers and a sound card that is Dolby Digital compatible.</li>
                    <li>There are many formats to choose from such as Dolby Digital EX, Dolby Digital Plus, and Dolby TrucHD.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>Network Card</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>An Ethernet network requires that you install or attach network adapters to each computer or peripheral you want to connect to the network. </li>
                    <li>Most computers come with Ethernet adapters preinstalled as network interface cards</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>RAM Memory</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Random access memory (RAM) is a series of small cards or modules plugged into slots on the motherboard. </li>
                    <li>The CPU can request any data in RAM. It is then located, opened, and delivered to the CPU for processing in a few billionths of a second. </li>
                    <li>Since all the contents of RAM are erased when you turn off the computer, RAM is the temporary or volatile storage location for the computer.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h1>Hardware Architecture and Organization</h1>

                <h3>Two Terms Related to Hardware</h3>
                <h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
                <p>Architecture describes the internal organization of a computer in an abstract way; that is, it defines the computer's capabilities and programming model. You can have two computers constructed in different ways with different technologies but with the same architecture. </p><br>
                <h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>
                <p>Organization describes how a computer is implemented. Organization is concerned with a computer's functional components and theirinterrelationship. Organization is about buses, timing, and circuits.</p><br>

                <h1 id="imphardware">Implementation of Hardware</h1>
                <h3>Business Majors</h3>
                <p>Hardware design impacts both individuals and organizations, influencing purchasing decisions and upgrades. For individuals, deciding when and what hardware to buy can be challenging due to rapid innovation. For organizations, the complexity increases as they manage multiple systems and must determine when legacy systems remain useful or need replacing. Legacy systems continue to be used as long as they meet users' needs, despite newer technologies being available.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Genetic Algorithms</h3>
                <p>Hardware is implemented in genetic algorithms (GAs) using Altera’s FLEX 10K FPGAs, integrated with a Pentium-based PC through high-speed PCI bus slots. Each slot hosts a GA board equipped with FPGA chips, a PCI bus interface, and a white noise generator. Configured via Altera Hardware Description Language (AHDL), the FPGAs utilize embedded array blocks (EABs) for efficient data storage and logic array blocks (LABs) for operations like crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.</p>
                <p>This setup leverages FPGA parallelism to accelerate GA processes, achieving faster performance than software-based methods. It is highly adaptable, allowing for reconfiguration through AHDL to support varied GA parameters and applications, such as real-time optimization in network routing.</p>
                <br>

                <h1 id="software">Computer Software</h1>
                <p>Computer software is the set of instructions that control the operation of the computer system. The terms "program" and "code" are used synonymously with software. System software includes programs that facilitate hardware use and allow the application software to run efficiently. Application software solves specific user problems. </p>
                <br>
                <h1 id="sysapp">System and Application Software</h1>
                <h3 id="system">System Software</h3>
                <p>Systems software acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and applications, managing essential functions like loading on startup and providing common instructions for all programs. Systems programming includes creating and maintaining this software.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="application">Application Software</h3>
                <p>Application software provides specific functions to users, ranging from general tasks like word processing to specialized tasks like payroll. Application programming involves creating, modifying, and improving this software, which can be proprietary or off-the-shelf. Many organizations use a variety of applications to meet their needs.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Systems Software</h1>
                <p>Systems software controls computer operations and facilitates programming, with the operating system (OS) as its primary type. The OS manages processes, resources, and input/output, providing a user interface that simplifies hardware interaction. GUIs allow users to control visible objects like icons, while natural user interfaces, known as NUIs, incorporate technologies like virtual reality and touch control.</p>
                <p>Examples of NUIs include haptic interfaces (e.g., Xbox Kinect, PlayStation Move, Wii) and touch-based interfaces like Microsoft Surface and Apple iPhone. Popular desktop OS examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Application Software</h1>
                <p>Application software enables computers to perform specific tasks, offering functionality for users. Because computers are used in diverse ways, there is a large variety of application programs available. Application software can be developed internally, custom-made by vendors, or obtained as off-the-shelf software, which is prepackaged and available for general purchase.</p>
                <p>Off-the-shelf software may be a standard package or customizable for specific needs, such as inventory or payroll management. The term "package" refers to these pre-developed programs sold commercially for organizational use.</p>
                <br>
                <h1 id="operating">Operating Systems</h1>
                <p>An operating system (OS) is specialized system software that manages computer operations, including processing schedules, resource allocation, and system usage. OS types are generally designed for batch processing or real-time processing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Batch Processing: Used when immediate responses aren’t required, processing collected data sequentially. Examples in healthcare include payroll, billing, and pharmacy tasks like creating drug-use reports.</li>
                    <li>Real-Time Processing: Responds instantly to user input, suitable for time-sensitive tasks. In healthcare, an example is checking for drug interactions upon entering new prescriptions.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>The OS composes control programs (managing I/O, job scheduling, and error handling) and processing programs (e.g. translators and utility programs). Translators convert code for the computer to execute, while utility programs perform functions like data transfer and file sorting.</p><br>
                <p>Selecting an OS depends on the intended use. Batch systems are unsuitable for high-interaction environments, while real-time systems aren't ideal for intensive data tasks. Healthcare often requires both types of processing.</p><br>
                <p>Operating systems can be enhanced by additional system software for specific applications or to extend functionality, such as teleprocessing support. Traditionally, OS development has been managed by hardware manufacturers, but UNIX, originating from Bell Labs, evolved into a widely compatible OS, now available for various hardware and scalable from personal computers to large, shared systems.</p><br>

                <h1 id="dms">Database Management System</h1>
                <p>System software technologies, such as Database Management Systems (DBMS), combine control and processing functions to streamline application development and maintenance. DBMS software reduces data duplication, facilitates data modification, and provides direct access for data inquiries. A key feature of DBMS is data independence, allowing files to be modified without changing existing applications, which enhances flexibility.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hierarchical databases: Organize data in a tree structure where each branch has one main branch but multiple sub-branches.</li>
                    <li>Network databases: Expand access by linking specific data elements across branches.</li>
                    <li>Relational databases: Store data in tables, allowing flexible relationships through table references, though this may impact performance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most DBMSs include report-generator software, enabling users to easily create custom reports without the need for programming, reducing costs for infrequent reporting tasks.</p><br>
                
                <h1 id="issues">Software Issues</h1>
                <h3>Software Defects</h3>
                <p>The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) defines good software as usable, reliable, defect-free, cost-effective, and maintainable. Despite efforts to address software quality, the industry still faces significant challenges, with professional programmers making an average of 100-150 errors per 1000 lines of code. While there is recognition of the issue, progress in resolving it is slow, and as our reliance on technology grows, the risks of software defects continue to increase.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Software Licensing</h3>
                <p>Software piracy is a significant issue, with the Business Software Alliance (BSA) investigating and acting on tips related to illegal copying. The BSA estimates that piracy costs software vendors billions annually. To protect their software, vendors use various techniques like network licensing and node-locking. In Australia, intellectual property, including software, is automatically protected under copyright laws. A survey revealed that 43% of organizations lack proper software license management processes, risking compliance failures and penalties, especially with the rise of BYOD and cloud computing.</p>

                <h1 id="impsoftware">Implementation of Software</h1>

                <h3>Science and Math</h3>
                <p>Software is essential in science and math, enabling simulations, experimentation, and solving problems beyond traditional methods. It allows scientists to model complex systems, like electron trajectories or neutron star conditions, and analyze chaotic phenomena such as turbulence and DNA folding. Algorithms and computational tools help identify patterns and behaviors, while experimental mathematics uses software to generate and validate conjectures. In "computationally irreducible" systems, where only step-by-step simulations reveal behaviors, software becomes the most effective tool for understanding complexity.</p><br>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>Software implementation in education provides tools like computer-aided instruction (CAI) and internet access, aiming to improve student outcomes. CAI, especially in subjects like math, adapts to student progress, showing promise worldwide. However, results are mixed, as technology can sometimes distract from traditional learning methods. Effective educational software requires careful integration with teaching practices to truly enhance learning.</p><br>
                <h3>Daily Life</h3>
                <p>Software is deeply integrated into daily life, shaping how people work, communicate, learn, and manage tasks. In education, tools like computer-aided instruction personalize learning, while in professional and personal contexts, software supports project management, data analysis, and productivity. Applications for communication, navigation, and entertainment streamline daily activities on smartphones and computers. This integration requires thoughtful implementation to keep software beneficial and aligned with users' needs, as its role continues to grow, automating tasks and creating new ways to connect and learn.</p><br>
                <h3>Difference of Hardware and Software</h3>
                <p>The difference between hardware and software often relies on criteria like modifiability, portability, and function, but each has limitations. For example, while software is often thought of as abstract and intangible, it still relies on physical storage, complicating its contrast with hardware's material nature. Additionally, hardware can hold embedded instructions, challenging the notion that only software contains sequences of operations.</p><br>
                <br><p>The idea of “logical equivalence” suggests software functions could, in principle, be implemented in hardware, and vice versa. While this fluidity blurs boundaries, distinct qualities remain, as hardware is bound by physical constraints and manufacturing, while software offers adaptability and can be altered for different environments. </p><br>
          
                <h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>
                <p>Creating this portfolio has helped me understand the intricate balance between computer hardware and software and the ways they shape so many areas of our lives. Each part, from physical components to the software that guides them, plays a role in the technology we rely on every day.</p><br>
                <p>Computer hardware is like the "body" of a computer. It includes all the tangible parts that enable it to function. At the center of it all is the central processing unit, or CPU, often called the "brain" of the computer. The CPU handles data and coordinates tasks between different components. Other parts, such as input and output devices, allow us to interact with the computer. Input devices such as keyboards, scanners, and touchpads send data to the CPU. Output devices, including screens and printers, then present the processed information back to us.</p><br>
                <p>Storage is also essential to a computer’s operation. Primary storage, also known as RAM or Random Access Memory, functions like the computer’s short-term memory, storing data temporarily while the CPU processes it. Secondary storage, like hard drives and SSDs, provides long-term storage so that we can save files and access them later. Power supply units convert energy to power these components, while cooling systems such as fans and heat sinks prevent overheating to keep the system running smoothly. Finally, the motherboard is the central circuit board that connects everything, ensuring that the parts communicate efficiently.</p><br>
                <p>One application of hardware is in genetic algorithms, which are used to solve complex problems with methods inspired by natural selection. Hardware like FPGA or Field-Programmable Gate Array chips is often used here because it allows faster processing by performing tasks simultaneously rather than sequentially. This parallel processing is especially helpful in network optimization and problem-solving, where speed and adaptability are key.</p><br>
                <p>If hardware is the body, then software is the "mind," directing everything. Software consists of system software and application software. System software, especially operating systems, or OS, acts as the bridge between hardware and applications. It handles core functions, from managing resources to controlling input and output, and offers us a user interface to interact with the system. Popular operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, allow us to run applications and manage files. Today, many systems use natural user interfaces, or NUIs, which include touch screens, virtual reality, and voice control to make interactions feel more intuitive.</p><br>
                <p>Application software allows us to accomplish specific tasks, whether we are writing a document or analyzing data. These programs can be specialized or general-purpose and are available as either pre-built, custom-made, or off-the-shelf solutions. Database Management Systems, or DBMS, are essential for organizing and managing data, which is especially important for businesses. DBMS tools help reduce data redundancy and streamline access to information.</p><br>
                <p>Different industries use software in unique ways to meet their needs. For example, financial software aids in cash flow management and budgeting, helping companies assess their financial health. Human resources software supports recruitment, payroll, and benefits administration, while production management software handles logistics and inventory. In education, computer-aided instruction, or CAI, provides students with personalized learning experiences, making it easier for them to understand complex subjects, especially in science and math.</p><br>
                <p>Software development faces challenges, however. Defects in software can lead to costly issues, and software piracy remains a problem that affects revenue for developers. Companies employ licensing methods to combat piracy, but compliance can be tricky, especially with the rise of remote work and cloud-based services.</p><br>
                <p>While hardware is physical and constrained by manufacturing, software is adaptable. It is designed to evolve and adjust to different environments, making it incredibly flexible. But the two depend on each other in ways that are not always obvious. Software needs physical storage, and even hardware often uses embedded software to perform specific functions. This interdependence is what makes modern computing possible, creating a digital ecosystem that powers everything from our daily tasks to complex scientific research.</p><br>
