            <h2>Gabrielle Chua</h2>
            <p>I am from Zamboanga City however I am currently living in Cebu Business Park. I graduated from Zamboanga Chong Hua High School and I am currently enrolled in the University of San Carlos in BS Information Technology.<br><br>
            Why I am pursuing BS Information Technology is because I don’t see myself working in any field other than in tech and I’ve had an interest with programming since grade 8 during my computer class wherein we learned the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>
