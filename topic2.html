                <p>Data is a broad term and can have many meanings with the following as examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Commonly used to refer to records or recordings encoded for use in computer, but is more widely used to refer to statistical observations and other recordings or collections of evidence.</li>
                    <li>Can be deﬁned as a class of information objects, made up of units of binary code that are intended to be stored, processed, and transmitted by digital computers.</li>
                    <li>Basic individual items of numeric or other information, garnered through observation; but in themselves, without context, they are devoid of information.</li>
                    <li>A symbol set that is quantiﬁed and/or qualiﬁed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Information is a broad term and can have many meanings with the following as examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used to refer to a number of different phenomena. These phenomena have been classiﬁed into three groupings: </li>
                        <ol id="info-group">
                            <li>Anything perceived as potentially signifying something (e.g. printed books)</li>
                            <li>The process of informing</li>
                            <li>That which is learned from some evidence or communication.</li>
                        </ol>                   
                    <li>Data that has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the recipient</li>
                    <li>The intentional composition of data by a sender with the goal of modifying the knowledge state of an interpreter or receiver.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1 id="is">Information Systems</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>An information system (IS) collects, processes, stores, analyzes, and disseminates information for a specific purpose.  </li>
                    <li>Involves a variety of information technologies (IT) such as computers, software, databases, communication systems, the Internet, mobile devices and much more, to perform specific tasks, interact with and inform various actors in different organizational or social contexts.</li>
                    <li>The purpose of information systems has been defined as getting the right information to the right people, at the right time, in the right amount, and in the right format.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Some of the common types of methodology used in the IS discipline are: </h3>

                <h1 id="sispm">Strategic Information Systems Planning</h1>
                <p>This type of methodology seeks to integrate and to align an organization’s strategic objectives with its existing information systems plan or business needs. SISP methodologies aim at assisting organizations in identifying opportunities by capitalizing on technologies for competitive advantage. </p>
                
                <h1 id="bprm">Business Process Re-engineering</h1>
                <p>Used to maximize corporate profitability by redesigning and transforming the organization’s business processes. </p>

                <h1 id="sdms">System Development Methodologies</h1>
                <p>Used in designing different types of information systems such as transaction processing systems, enterprise information systems, decision support systems, etc. </p>

                <h1 id="ism">Information Security Methodologies</h1>
                <p>Assist organizations to establish a security plan to address vulnerability associated with unauthorized misuse of information.</p>

                <h1 id="isst">Information Systems Strategy Triangle</h1>
                <p>Successful firms have an overriding business strategy that drives both organizational strategy and IS strategy. The decisions made regarding the structure, hiring practices, vendor policies, and other organizational design components, as well as decisions regarding applications, platforms, and other IS components, are all driven by the firm's business objectives, strategies, and tactics. Successful firms carefully align these three strategies they purposely design their organizational and IS strategies to complement their business strategy.<br><br>
                IS strategy can itself affect and is affected by changes in a firm's business and organizational design. To perpetuate the alignment needed for successful operation, changes in the IS strategy must be accompanied by changes in the organizational strategy and must accommodate the overall business strategy. If a firm designs its business strategy to use IS to gain strategic advantage, it can only sustain that advantage by constant innovation. The business, IS, and organizational strategies must constantly be adjusted.<br><br>
                IS strategy always involves consequences—intended or not-within business and organizational strategies. Avoiding harmful unintended consequences means remembering to consider business and organi- zational strategies when designing IS implementation. For example, deploying tablets to employees without an accompanying set of changes to job expectations, process design, compensation plans, and business tactics will fail to achieve expected productivity improvements. Success can be achieved only by specifically designing all three components of the strategy triangle so they properly complement each other.</p>

                <h3>Management Pyramid at 4 Levels</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Executive Support Systems (ESS)</li>
                    <li>Decision Support Systems (DSS)</li>
                    <li>Management Information Systems (MIS)</li>
                    <li>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)</li>
                </ol>

                <h1 id="tis">Topology of Information Systems</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>A company has systems to support the different managerial levels. These systems include transaction processing systems, management information systems, decision support systems, and dedicated business intelligence systems. Companies use information systems so that accurate and up-to-date information is available when needed. </li>
                    <li>A common approach for examining the types of information systems used within organizations is to classify them according to their roles at different organizational structure levels, and this approach is called a vertical approach. </li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="tps">Transaction Processing Systems</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Computer system that performs and records the routine (daily) operations necessary for managing affairs, such as keeping employee records, payroll, shipping merchandise, keeping records, accounting and treasury.</li>
                    <li>Collects data continuously, typically in real time-that is, as soon as the data are generated-and it provides the input data for the corporate databases. </li>
                    <li>They are considered critical to the success of any enterprise because they support core operations. </li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="mis">Management Information Systems</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extracts data from a database to compile reports, such as sales analyses, inventory-level reports, and financial statements, to help managers make routine decisions. </li>
                    <li>Management information systems (MIS) use the data collected by the TPS to provide supervisors with the necessary control reports.</li>
                    <li>This level contains computer systems that are intended to assist operational management in monitoring and controlling the transaction processing activities that occur at clerical level. </li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="dss">Decision Support Systems</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interactive computer-based systems and subsystems intended to help decision makers use communications technologies, data, documents, knowledge and/or models to complete decision process tasks.</li>
                    <li>Kind of organizational information computerize systems that helps a manager in decision making that needs modeling, formulation, calculating, comparing, selecting the best option or predict the scenarios.</li>
                    <li>While DSSs use internal information from TPS and MIS systems, they also leverage external sources, such as stock quotes or competitor product prices. </li>
                    <li>This type of system attempts to answer questions such as: What would impact production schedules if we were to double sales for December? What would the level of Return on investment be if the plant schedule were delayed by more than six months?</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="tdss">Types of Decision Support Systems</h1>
                <h3>Communication-driven DSS</h3>
                <p id="tdss-content">Most communications-driven DSSs are targeted at internal teams, including partners. Its purpose are to help conduct a meeting, or for users to collaborate. The most common technology used to deploy the DSS is a web or client server. </p>
                <h3>Data-driven DSS</h3>
                <p id="tdss-content">Most data-driven DSSs are targeted at managers, staff and also product/service suppliers. It is used to query a database or data warehouse to seek specific answers for specific purposes. It is deployed via a main frame system, client/server link, or via the web.</p>
                <h3>Document-driven DSS</h3>
                <p id="tdss-content">More common and targeted at a broad base of user groups. The purpose of such a DSS is to search web pages and find documents on a specific set of keywords or search terms. The usual technology used to set up such DSSs are via the web or a client/server system. </p>
                <h3>Knowledge-driven DSS:</h3>
                <p id="tdss-content">Knowledge-driven DSSs or 'knowledgebase' are they are known, are a catch-all category covering a broad range of systems covering users within the organization seting it up, but may also include others interacting with the organization - for example, consumers of a business. It is essentially used to provide management advice or to choose products/services. The typical deployment technology used to set up such systems could be slient/server systems, the web, or software runnIng on stand-alone PCs.</p>
                <h3>Model-driven DSS</h3>
                <p id="tdss-content">Model-driven DSSs are complex systems that help analyse decisions or choose between different options. These are used by managers and staff members of a business, or people who interact with the organization, for a number of purposes depending on how the model is set up - scheduling, decision analyses etc. These DSSs can be deployed via software/hardware in stand-alone PCs, client/server systems, or the web.</p>

                <h1 id="ess">Executive Support Systems</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide rapid access to both internal and external information, often presented in graphical format, but with the ability to present more detailed underlying data if it is required.</li>
                    <li>designed to integrate data from the external environment, such as new taxes or competitor data, and integrate aggregate data from MIS and DSS. ESSs filter, synthesize and track critical data.</li>
                    <li>These systems include business intelligence analysis tools to identify key trends and forecasts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>
                <p>Technology has various areas, including information technology and information systems. Throughout this portfolio, I've come to understand the differences between data and information. Data typically refers to recorded information used in computers, but it also includes statistical observations and other forms of evidence. On the other hand, information is the processed form of data that holds meaning for the recipient. </p><br>
                <p>Information systems (IS) are crucial in collecting, processing, storing, analyzing, and disseminating information for specific purposes. The main objective of these systems is to deliver the right information to the right people, at the right time, in the right amount, and in the right format. Within IS, various methodologies are commonly used, including strategic information systems planning, business process re-engineering, strategic system development methodologies, and information security methodologies. These methodologies are aimed at aligning organizational strategic objectives with information systems, identifying opportunities for competitive advantage, and enhancing organizational business processes. Additionally, they are used in designing different types of information systems and establishing security plans to address vulnerabilities associated with unauthorized information misuse.</p><br>
                <p>Furthermore, information systems encompass four main types of support systems, namely Transaction Processing Systems, Management Information Systems, Decision Support Systems, and Executive Support Systems. These systems are designed to facilitate routine operations, compile reports, aid decision-making, and provide rapid access to internal and external information. Within the Decision Support Systems, there are five types: Communication-driven DSS, Data-driven DSS, Document-driven DSS, Knowledge-driven DSS, and Model-Driven DSS. The purpose of communication-driven DSS is to facilitate meetings or enable user collaboration. Data-driven DSS is utilized to extract specific answers from a database or data warehouse for particular purposes. Document-driven DSS is designed to search web pages and locate documents based on specific keywords or search terms. Knowledge-driven DSS is primarily used to offer management advice or make product or service selections. Model-driven DSS is employed by managers, staff members, or individuals interacting with an organization for various purposes based on the model configuration, such as scheduling and decision analyses.</p>
