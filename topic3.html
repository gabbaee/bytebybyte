                <h1 id="ns">Number Systems</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any system that is used for naming or representing numbers is a number system, also known as a numeral system.</li>
                    <li>A number system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for expressing numbers, that is a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, consistently using digits or other symbols.</li>
                    <li>A number system is a set of symbols used to express quantities as the basis for counting, determining order, comparing amounts, performing calculations, and representing value. </li>
                    <li>It is the set of characters and mathematical rules that are used to represent a number.</li>
                    <li>Number systems provide the foundation for many Computer Science and Engineering topics, making them one of the most fundamental concepts in Computer Science and Engineering education. </li>
                    <li>Computers communicate and operate in binary digits 0 and 1; on the other hand, human beings generally use decimal systems with ten digits 0-9. </li>
                    <li>Other number systems are also used in digital systems, such as octal with eight digits i.e. 0-7, and hexadecimal system with digits from 0-15. In the hexadecimal system, digits 10-15 are designated as A through F. </li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="2systems">Number System can be categorized in two-systems:</h1>
                <h3>Positional Number System</h3>
                <p>There are only a few symbols called digits, representing different values depending on their position in the number. The value of each digit in such a number is determined by three considerations: The digit itself, the position of the digit in the number, and the base of the number system. </p>
                <h3>Non-positional number system</h3>
                <p>Each number in each position does not have to be positional itself. Every system varies by country and it depends on symbols and values set by the people of that country. This system has symbols such as I for 1, II for 2, III for 3, IIII for 4, IIIII for 5, etc. The unary number system is under this category. </p>

                    <li>Octal Number System</li>
                    <li>Hexadecimal Number System</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h1 id="decimal">Decimal Number System</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is known as the international system of numbers.</li>
                    <li>Decimal notation often refers to a base-10 positional notation or denary number system; however, it can also be used more generally to refer to nonpositional systems. </li>
                    <li>Positional decimal systems include a zero and use symbols (called digits) for the ten values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) to represent any number, no matter how large or how small.</li>
                    <li>It is the numerical base most widely used by modern civilization.</li>
                    <li>The power of the base is multiplied by the number in that position to determine the value for that position. All numbers to the left of the decimal point are whole numbers or integers, and all numbers to the right of the decimal point are fractional numbers.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1 id="binary">Binary Number System</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>The number system with base (or radix) 2, is known as the binary number system.</li>
                    <li>The Binary numbers form the native language of computers and it is used internally by modern computers and its associated equipment due to its straight forward implementation in electronic circuitry. </li>
                    <li>Only two symbols are used to represent numbers in this system and these are 0 and 1, these are known as bits. </li>
                    <li>It is a positional system i.e. every position is assigned a specific weight. </li>
                    <li>In binary number system the left–most bit is known as most significant bit (MSB) and the right–most bit is known as the least significant bit (LSB).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1 id="octal">Octal Number System</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Octal numbers are used for entering binary data and displaying certain information in short.</li>
                    <li>Similar to decimal and binary number systems, it is also a positional system; the octal number system uses a power of 8 to determine the value of a number’s position. </li>
                    <li>In this system, eight symbols, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are used to represent the number. Hence, any octal number can not have any digit greater than 7.</li>
                    <li>The most significant and least significant digits will be determined in the same manner as the other number systems.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="hexa">Hexadecimal Number System</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>The hexadecimal number system is very popular in computer use. The base for the hexadecimal number system is 16 which requires 16 distinct symbols to represent the number. These are numerals 0 through 9 and alphabets A through F. </li>
                    <li>This is an alphanumeric number system because it uses both alphabets and numerals to represent a hexadecimal number.</li>
                    <li>The hexadecimal number system uses 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. </li>
                    <li>The most significant and least significant digits will be determined in the same manner as the other number systems.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="conversion">Conversion</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decimal to Binary conversion: Divide the decimal number (Dividend) by 2. </li>
                    <li>Decimal to Octal conversion: Divide the decimal number (Dividend) by 8. </li>
                    <li>Decimal to Hexadecimal conversion: Divide the decimal number (Dividend) by 16.</li>
                    <li>Binary to Decimal conversion: Multiply the binary number with 2's power. </li>
                    <li>Octal to Decimal conversion: Multiply the octal number with 8's power. </li>
                    <li>Hexadecimal to Decimal: Multiply the hexadecimal number with 16's power.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 id="significance">Significance</h1>
                <h3>Decimal Number System</h3>
                <p>The decimal system (base-10) is the most familiar to humans, used in everyday arithmetic, scientific notation, and financial transactions. Its widespread use makes it a universal language for numerical representation.</p><br>
                <h3>Binary Number System</h3>
                <p>The binary system (base-2) is fundamental to computing and digital electronics, representing data and instructions using only two symbols: 0 and 1. This simplicity aligns well with the on/off states of digital circuits, making it efficient and foundational for all modern technology. </p><br>
                <h3>Octal Number System</h3>
                <p>It is less common today, however it was historically used in older computer systems and programming languages. It simplifies binary representation by grouping binary digits into sets of three, making it easier to read and interpret.</p><br>
                <h3>Hexadecimal Number System</h3>
                <p>Commonly used in computing to simplify binary code, making it easier to read and understand. It is also used in web design and graphic design to represent colors in a compact form. Hexadecimal provides a more compact and readable form of binary data, reducing the length of binary strings and aiding in memory addressing and debugging in computer systems.</p>


                <h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>
                <p>After doing research for my portfolio, I’ve developed a much clearer understanding of number systems and their crucial role in computing. This knowledge is really important for me as a BS Information Technology student and someone aiming to become a software developer. Number systems aren't just abstract concepts; they're essential tools that shape how we interact with technology. There are four commonly used number systems: decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.</p><br>
                <p>The decimal number system is what we use every day. It’s based on 10 digits, 0 through 9, and is second nature to us because it’s what we use for everything from counting apples to handling finances. This system is deeply embedded in our daily lives and is fundamental to many aspects of human activity.</p><br>
                <p>Then we have the binary number system, which is the backbone of computer technology. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent data. These binary digits, or bits, are the basic building blocks of computer processing. Essentially, everything a computer does—whether it's running applications, processing data, or executing commands—is done using this on-off language.</p><br>
                <p>Then there’s the octal number system, which uses a base of 8 and digits 0 through 7. While it’s not as commonly used today, it was quite important in the past, especially in older computer systems and programming. Octal simplifies binary data by grouping bits into sets of three, making long binary numbers easier to read and manage.</p><br>
                <p>Lastly, we have the hexadecimal system, which uses a base of 16 and includes digits 0 through 9 along with letters A through F. This system is like a more compact and readable version of binary. It’s especially useful in programming and design like when specifying colors in web design or debugging code. Hexadecimal allows us to work with large binary numbers more efficiently, which is crucial for tasks involving memory addresses and data representation.</p><br>
                <p>Understanding these number systems isn’t just academic; it’s practical and essential for working in IT. Each system has its own set of rules and applications, and knowing how to use them helps me solve problems and work more effectively with technology.</p>
